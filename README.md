## üî•LAB503: AVS from Migration and Optimization to Modernization

**Note**: AVS stands for Azure VMware Solution

Join AVS Community on LinkedIn: [AVSPros](https://aka.ms/AVSPros)

### Session Description

Participants will engage in a structured hands-on lab designed to have end-to-end real‚Äëworld Azure VMware Solution (AVS) deployment and modernization workflows. The environment leverages click-through AVS LABs. This lab covers six learning modules representing key stages from discovery to modernization. The first three are mandatory and the rest are optional.

Core modules include:
1. Use Azure Portal to deploy AVS private cloud and manage VMware vSphere environment in Azure.
2. VMs Migration using VMware HCX: Leverage HCX capabilities to migrate VMs from on‚Äëprem into the AVS private cloud.
3. Modernize application running on AVS private cloud by moving SQL to Azure SQL Managed Instance in Azure.

Optional modules include:
1. Private Connectivity & Internet Access: establish secure AVS connectivity using Azure Route Server and Azure Firewall.
2. Expand AVS Storage with Azure Services: explore and integrate Azure NetApp Files or Elastic SAN as additional datastore options for vSphere, enabling to scale storage independently from compute to meet evolving capacity needs.
3. Azure Arc management of AVS & VMs:  Onboard AVS private cloud to Azure Arc as well as the migrated VMs enabling using Azure interfaces for monitoring and governance of AVS workloads.

### üß† Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- ‚úÖ Deploy and configure an Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud using Azure Portal.
- üöö Migrate VMs from on-premises environment to AVS using VMware HCX.
- üöÄ Modernize AVS workloads by integrating with Azure services such as Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure AI capabilities.
- üß≠ Arc-enable AVS private cloud and VMs to manage workloads via Azure interfaces for monitoring, policy, and governance.
- üì¶ Expand AVS storage using Azure NetApp Files or Azure Elastic SAN, enabling independent scaling of storage from compute.
- üîê Establish secure network connectivity using ExpressRoute/VPN and Azure Virtual WAN to enable controlled internet access.
